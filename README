"Hacme Central"
by brad.antoniewicz@foundstone.com
-------------------------------------

This is a really basic "Hacme" I created for 
high school students. In the first couple of
slides I introduce myself and mention that I
have a dog named "Mr Muffy". About 3 or 4 
slides later, I ask them to hack my account.

It's up to the students to guess my username 
and ultimately figure out they need to use the
forgot password page and provide my dog's name 
to get my password. 

This requires PHP (you can run it on backtrack), 
and you'll need to modify the source if you want
to use a new username and password or change
the success message.
